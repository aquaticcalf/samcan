## vector 2d

- constructor -> create vector (x,y)

- add, subtract -> take another vector and add/sub them to our little guy here

- multiply, divide -> take a scalar in and mul/div x and y with that

- dot -> dot product of our guy and another vector

- length, lengthSqaured -> used to calculate the magnitude of our guy

- normalize -> gives a unit vector in the same direction as our guy

- distance, distanceSquared -> distance between two vectors, len( a - b )

- clone -> returns a copy of our guy

- equals -> returns true or false, on whether a = b, with a certain min threshold ( epsilon )

- set -> is used to set x and y of our guy

- setFrom -> copies another vectors x and y into our guy

- lerp -> find a vector between our guy and another vector, at a specific ratio??

- zero -> ( 0, 0 )

- one -> ( 1, 1 )

- right -> ( 1, 0 )

- up -> ( 0, 1 )


observation : origin is at left bottom
